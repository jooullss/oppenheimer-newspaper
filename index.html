            <h2>A MAN OF MANY CONTRADICTIONS</h2>
            <p class="par2">Robert J. Oppenheimer was acomplex and contradictory figure. 
                Brilliant theoretical physicist, a charismatic leader, 
                and a deeply troubled man. He wrestled with the moral implications of his work, grappling with the destructive power he had helped to unleash.

        <div class="paragraph p2">
            <h2>SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
            <p>In addition to his work on the atomic bomb, 
                Oppenheimer made several other important scientific discoveries. 
                He developed the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which is a method
                 for simplifying the quantum mechanical equations for molecules. 
                He also worked on the theory of electrons and positrons, and he discovered 
                the Oppenheimer-Phillips process, 
                which is a way of creating nuclear fusion.</p>

        <div class="paragraph p1">
            <h2>SCIENTIST WITH <BR> A HUMANIST'S TOUCH</h2>
            <p>Oppenheimer's passion for literature and philosophy is evident in his 
                writings and speeches. He often quoted poets and philosophers, 
                and his own writing is infused with a sense of literary and philosophical depth.
                 This ability to connect science to the broader human experience made 
                 him a charismatic and influential figure in the scientific community.</p>
